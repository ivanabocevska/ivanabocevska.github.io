I am deeply committed to the development of both science and the community around it, with a strong focus on creating sustainable structures for future generations.

In recent years, my engagement has focused strongly on mentorship and empowering young people, especially young girls, to explore STEM fields. Through speed mentoring and school workshops within the **"Algorithmen Denken Anders - Tagebuch der Informatikerin"-initiative** at the Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms, I have shared insights into studying and working in MINT, aiming to motivate girls aged 13-16 to pursue their interests with confidence. 

I am also actively involved in **"Young Science"** events at TU Vienna, where we visit schools and conduct CS Unplugged workshops with students aged 6-18, teaching fundamental computer science concepts such as algorithms, sorting, and divide-and-conquer through playful, hands-on activities. 

Currently, I am involved in the organization of a hackathon for young girls in cooperation the City of Vienna as part of the **"Digital Days"-initiative**. The goal is to support participants throughout the entire process, from idea development to implementation and final presentation, while fostering teamwork, creativity, and self-confidence. 

I am also contributing to the ongoing restructuring and strategic development of **"Women in Informatics"-initiatives** at the Faculty of Computer Science at TU Vienna.
