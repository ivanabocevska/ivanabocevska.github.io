---

<p>I am a PhD student at the Doctoral School of <a href="https://forsyte.at/groups/apre/" target="_blank">Automated Reasoning</a>, <a href="https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/" target="_blank">Faculty of Informatics</a>, <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/" target="_blank">Vienna University of Technology</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://lkovacs.com/" target="_blank">Laura Kovács</a>.</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software and Information Engineering and a Master’s degree in Logic and Computation, both from <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/" target="_blank">Vienna University of Technology</a>.</p>

<p>I have gained research experience as a Student Researcher at <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/" target="_blank">Vienna University of Technology</a> in Vienna, Austria and as a Research Intern at the <a href="https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank">National Institute of Informatics</a> in Tokyo, Japan. Additionally, I have worked as a Solution Engineer at <a href="https://www.boc-group.com/" target="_blank">BOC Group</a>.</p>

<h3>Research Area</h3>

<p>My research aims to develop formal methods and automated reasoning techniques that ensure the correctness and reliability of systems on which modern society critically depends. </p>

<p></p>My research so far has focused on the formal analysis of blockchain protocols from a game-theoretic perspective, modelling the economic incentives that drive user behaviour. In this regard, I contributed to a verification tool that can uncover real-world vulnerabilities. To scale this analysis to large protocols, we developed compositionality techniques that reduce verification times from hours to minutes and enable the analysis of previously infeasible protocol instances.</p>

<p></p>Building on these results, we identified a key limitation of current verification technology: existing solvers scale well for linear systems but struggle with non-linear reasoning. Addressing this challenge is a central direction of my PhD.
